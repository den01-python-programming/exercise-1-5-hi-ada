# Exercise 1.4 - Message

Write a program that asks the user to write a string. When the user has provided a string (i.e., written some text and pressed the enter key), the program should print the string that was provided by the user.

The exercise template comes with a program template that includes the function and its call.

```python
def message_print():
    message = input("Write a message:")
    # Write your code here
    
message_print()
```

Example output for when the user writes "Bye".

```plaintext
Write a message:
*Bye*
Bye
```

Example output for when the user writes "Once upon a time...".

```plaintext
Write a message:
*Once upon a time...*
Once upon a time...
```
